                Hi! My name is Sveta and this is my story.
                
                I love web development and want to do it for a job. How did I get there? It all started as a hobby. Doing various online courses and code katas I eventually realised that I would like to do it full time. So, I started looking at job openings and see what gaps did I have in my knowledge. Luckily, having more than 5 years of experience as a QA Engineer I have quite a lot of experience with the software development life cycle, agile practices and working in a team. Therefore I focused on my web development skills and now I am feeling much more confident working with HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, React, Git, Nodejs and even MongoDB. Thanks to my previous job, I deeply understand what quality and customer focus means. In retrospective, I think I chose that job because I like solving puzzles, getting to the bottom of the bug and understanding its root cause. What I didn't know is that programming puzzles are much more fun to solve. To be fair, I never thought that I would enjoy web development so much and if someone told me that, I would probably say "me? yeah, right...". But here I am now, one step from starting my successful career in web development.
                
                One the social side, I like travelling and socks with funny patterns.
